    <p>Today we started doing our website and did a fun experiment. We had to engineer a way to make a marble go into a bucket with pipes. Our team got first place! We also went over safety and the Engineering Process. Safety included wearing the proper items like safety goggles and aprons and also included common sense stuff, such as not playing with knives. The Engineering Process is very similar to the Scientific Method; identifying a proble, making a solution, and improving that solution. That's all for today!</p>

    <p>Up to this day, our class has been very busy. Lately we have gone over Rube Goldberg machines. We first started with CADing our machines. My group is planning on making a pulley to set off another ball that sets off a car that pops a balloon. After that, we started cutting out cardboard so we could make or machine. We had some extra cardboard so I made a greatsword! Today we also took a Mechanical Engineering quiz. I had some trouble answering some questions but hope I get a good grade! Mechanical engineering involves the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of machines and mechanical systems. I learned a fun fact: the wheel was one of the first mechanical inventions! That's all for today!</p>
