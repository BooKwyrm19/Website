    <p>Today we started doing our website and did a fun experiment. We had to engineer a way to make a marble go into a bucket with pipes. Our team got first place! We also went over safety and the Engineering Process. Safety included wearing the proper items like safety goggles and aprons and also included common sense stuff, such as not playing with knives. The Engineering Process is very similar to the Scientific Method; identifying a proble, making a solution, and improving that solution. That's all for today!</p>

    <p>Up to this day, our class has been very busy. Lately we have gone over Rube Goldberg machines. We first started with CADing our machines. My group is planning on making a pulley to set off another ball that sets off a car that pops a balloon. After that, we started cutting out cardboard so we could make or machine. We had to make pillars to support the ramps, so we made those out of cardboard and then stuck them into the base with sharpened skewers. We had some extra cardboard so I made a greatsword! Today we also took a Mechanical Engineering quiz. I had some trouble answering some questions but hope I get a good grade! Mechanical engineering involves the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of machines and mechanical systems. I learned a fun fact: the wheel was one of the first mechanical inventions! That's all for today!</p>

    <p>Today and this week we finished making our Rube Goldberg Machines. Our design was relatively simple: we would start with a ramp, make a pulley, and then roll a ball down that set off a mechanism that popped the balloon. However, we encountered many problems on our second day of design. First, we had to make the pulley mechanism, which proved harder than it seemed. We had to make a base for the pulley so that it would work properly. Then we made two boxes for the baseball to go into until we realized that the baseball wouldn't fit in the box. We pivoted and instead went with multiple marbles rolling down the ramp at the same time. We eventually got the pulley mechanism to work and then we had to find a solution on how we would make a second ball roll down a ramp to pop the balloon. We ended up putting a marble on a flat surface and when the pulley went down, it would set the marble off. It didn't really work until one of my teammates made a small wedge (a small cardboard piece with a ton of tape around it) and put it behind the marble, which somehow made everything work. After that we added a ramp and a turning mechanism so when the marble hit the mechanism at high velocities it would turn the mechanism and make the balloon pop. This was the final step, and all we hd to do now was record. We finally got it on our ninth try because there were some technical difficulties with the pulley. The video is attached below. That's all for today! </p>
